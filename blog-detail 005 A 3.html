                          <p>[Professor]: “Okay. Starting from the first row, introduce yourself in Japanese.” 
                            <br>
                            <br> [Sisu]: “初めまして。私は シス です” 
                            <br> (Hajimemashite. Watashi wa Sisu desu. /Hello! My name is Sisu…. )
                            <br> 
                            <br> People always ask me to introduce myself, but I always want to ask them back, but I hold it back. In my mind, “do you even remember my name after this moment. 
                            I mean after I am done talking??”. The answer might be “No” if you aren’t smart enough to remember the names of people whom you met just only one time for the first time.
                            <br> 
                            <br> Sometimes, people ask you a lot of random questions. 
                            Sometimes, people put on convincing fake smiles to hide their real emotions even if they do not feel like doing so.
                            Maybe it’s just because they want to conform to the society that they live in? Or they are scared of being left out of society?
                            <br> 
                            <br> And people do not tend to care much about strangers if you aren’t special to them. 
                            That’s why I don’t have so many friends because I don’t have time to make small talk and I am busy working to survive. 
                            I don’t feel sorry or sad for living like that though. Wanna know why? I am a voluntary outsider. 
                            <br> 
                            <br> Anyway, I have to do it again at the job interview after class.
                            I don’t know how many times I introduce myself to others at the interviews. I wrote 3000 words for my cover letter. 
                            What did I get in return???? Two lines of rejection… I can’t even count the rejections letter in my email. 
                            Rejection is a normal thing to me. Rejections do not make me a loser, but I might become a loser if I am scared of rejections and decide to stop trying.    
                            <br>
                            <br>………
                            <br>
                            <br> Sisu is spacing out for a few seconds without knowing that the class is already finished. 
                            <br>
                            <br> At the moment, a guy quietly comes into the lecture room from the back door and sits next to Sisu. 
                            He has very broad shoulders, which is wide enough to carry a yacht on his shoulders and you might probably want to lean on his shoulders if you have a bad day.
                            He has strong brows and jawline. He also has unique monolid eyes. His cheeks are pink from the cold. When he smiles, you can see his killer dimples.
                            His smile might be the most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen and can melt the hearts of many girls for sure. His lips are like a juicy cherry with a defined cupid’s bow.
                            If you stare at it too long, you will probably want to kiss him. 
                            <br>
                            <br> He whispers to Sisu, “Hey, can you pass me the attendance sheet? I am late and I haven’t signed it yet.”
                            <br>
                            <br>[Sisu]: "Sure.” (She passes the attendance sheet to him.) 
                            <br>
                            <br> [Professor]: “Any questions? No one? Well, then. 
                            Tomorrow, we will have a group discussion, so make sure you read the whole chapter and don’t forget to give me the attendance sheet.”
                            <br> (The professor walks out of the class)
                            <br>
                            <br> After the class is over, a group of girls come and ask Sisu whether she is close to Yuto—the guy who asked her to pass the attendance sheet. 
                            Sisu coldly answers them, “No” and quickly leaves tothe interview without eating lunch. 
                            On the way, she stops her motorbike in front of a convenience store and buys some bread and Banana Milk, but she knows herself well that she can’t eat anything when she is anxious.
                            <br>
                            <br> When she gets to the interview waiting room, she is nervously waiting for her turn. 
                            A few minutes later, an interviewer calls her name. She follows her and goes into the room. 
                            The interview went smoothly and Sisu didn’t make any mistakes during the interview. 
                            <br>
                            <br> Yet, she feels a little bit hopeless after the interview because almost all of the applicants who came to the interview are graduates. 
                            Compared to them, the possibility to get a job for her is low because she is still an undergraduate student. 
                            <br>
                            <br>To cut off her thoughts, she goes into the restroom. She closes the door and sits on a toilet seat for a few seconds. 
                            While sitting there, she can hear the staccato clicks of high heels echoing off of the floor and walls outside. Then, a group of women come inside the restroom to fix their makeup.
                            <br>
                            <br> A woman starts talking to other women. <br> [The Woman]: “I can’t believe that Applicant 102 is the CEO’s son”
                            <br>
                            <br> [Second Woman]: “Yup, that’s his third son. I heard that he is not interested in taking over his father’s business. Maybe he came to interview today because he is afraid of his dad?”
                            <br>
                            <br> [Third Woman]: “Seriously!? Then, our manager will select him for sure. I kinda feel sorry for other applicants tho. I saw an applicant who is a Straight-A student, 
                            but what’s the point of studying hard and getting good grades when the result is already decided.”
                            <br>
                            <br> [Second Woman]: “IKR, that’s what life is about. Anyway, guys! Let’s go back to the office. Otherwise, our <strong>Kkondae</strong> manager will preach us till our ears bleed.” 
                            <br>
                            <br> (*Click <a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2021/03/16/culture/features/boomer-kkondae-korean-age/20210316151300418.html"><strong>HERE</strong> to search for the meaning of <strong>Kkondae</strong></a> )

                            <br> …………
                            <br>
                            <br> Only Sisu is left in the toilet, and she gets up with a long hopeless sigh. 
                            She had no problem crying in the past, but now her tear well is starting to run dry 
                            since she did so many times to repress her emotions—consciously and subconsciously whenever life is getting hard for her to live. 
                            As time goes by, all of the senses are numb as if they were paralyzed. Only deeply sighing became her habit. 
                            <br>

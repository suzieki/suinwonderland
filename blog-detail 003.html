                    <h2 class="mb-3">Do you ever forget to take care of yourself? If yes, don’t worry. You’re not alone. </h2> <br>

                    <p>I also rarely took care of myself. I also had mental and physical pains because I didn’t care much about myself no matter how hurt I was. I was always focusing on meeting the expectations of me and others. My body and mind were in so much pain, but I never thought about treating myself. I went to the rooftop so many times, but I still remember I went there twice with an intentiona to jump off from there. If my mom didn’t phone me on that day, I won’t probably see so many beautiful things that happened to me later. I’m glad that I didn’t choose that option because all negative reactions of others and unhelpful thoughts aren’t worth giving up on myself. I admit that I failed to take care of myself and kept the wounds inside me without treating them in the past. As time went by, I began to take care of myself better. The following ideas are my tiny self-care tips.</p>
                    
                    <br><p>1.	Getting Adequate Sleep <br> <br>
                      I know it’s difficult for students to get enough sleep. As a student, we get stress from assignments, deadlines, exams, and tests. To meet the deadlines, we had to endure sleep deprivation and pass so many sleepless nights. Sometimes, insomnia also tortures us. Yet, most people need around 7 or 8 hours of quality sleep. If you don’t have enough sleep every day, it can severely affect your physical and mental health. For me, if I have so many assignments to finish off, I exchange sleeping time with eating. I eat a lot because I need to finish the assignment without sleeping. If I cannot sleep because of insomnia, I drink some warm milk, do some breathing exercise, and turn off the light. Slowly, I fall asleep. Or if you have a stressful or bad day, don’t think too much. Just go to bed and sleep.  </p>
                    
                    <br><p>2.	Socialization <br> <br>
                      Even if you are busy, you should keep a certain time to devote yourself to your friends or your family. Friends mean those whom you think you are comfortable with (Not toxic friends). It is important to express that you care for them because they are the people who will accept you as you are. You can talk to them about your worries or anything you wanna talk about. They are precious people you can lean on when you are in a difficult situation. Don’t forget that “human are social animals”.  </p>
                    
                    <br><p>3.	Hugging Someone <br> <br>
                      This is difficult for many of us to do. Right? But it is the most effective therapy for me when I am sad. Hugging my mom makes me feel like I’m safe and telling me that everything gonna fine soon. I agree with the statement that “Hugs speak louder than words”. Sometimes, when you have difficult times, all you need is a hug.  </p>
                     
                    <br><p>4.	Listen to Music!  <br> <br>
                      Listening to Music is the most important daily activity like sleeping or eating for me. I listen to songs depending on the mood. And Music is like a dopamine reward to alter my mood and diminish undesirable emotion. I mostly listen to K-pop because I am learning Korean and there are many K-pop songs that I can relate to. The lyrics are meaningful and give me positive vibe. Make sure you go to the K-pop context section. I made a list of songs that I usually listen to when I am tired.   </p>
                      
                    <br><p>5.	5-minute daily meditation <br> <br>
                      On weekends, I do 1-hour meditation, but on weekdays I can only do 5-minute meditation before I go to sleep. This makes my mind fresh and clean. This also improves my concentration in class.  </p>
                      
                    <br><p>6.	Avoid procrastination!  <br> <br>
                      Procrastination is like a lover for most of the students, but we need to break up with procrastination to decrease stress and anxiety attacks. Break up with procrastination might be a pain but putting off a task is not good for us. I also don’t like living in terror to finish the task a minute before the deadline. The quality of work done is also different if I have more time to finish off the task compared with the one I have done with panic to meet the deadline quickly.  </p>
                      
                    <br><p>7.	Cleaning <br> <br>
                      If you have an argument with your friends or someone, don’t keep it in your mind so long. Just do cleaning your room. Or wash your clothes. Or throw away trashes.  </p>
                       
                    <br><p>8.	Eat!!!!!!!  <br> <br>
                      Whenever I have a bad day, I always eat spicy food with milk. Yet, keep in mind that eating spicy food every day doesn’t good for your stomach. You also should keep away yourself from junk food. Make sure you have nutritious and healthy diet every day.   </p>
                     
                    <br><p>9.	Do window shopping!  <br> <br>
                      I don’t like sweets, so I look for an alternative way to lift my mood. When I am stressed, I go out instead of staying in my room. Since I like fashion, looking at clothes is a way of changing my mood. I know it doesn’t work for everyone. Anyway, window shopping is an effective therapy for stress especially for me.  </p>
                         
                    <br><p>10.	Go to Stationery Stores   <br> <br>
                      I have a weird habit. I love collecting pens, books, and other accessories. That’s a habit that I have since middle school. Even looking at accessories give me a hit of dopamine. I don’t know why though. Isn’t it weird? AS A TIMI, I don’t like people giving me stationery as a present because I have my taste and their taste doesn’t match with my taste.   </p>
                    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">That's it for today. I left a song below. Good Luck!</h2>
                    
                    <blockquote>If you look at it in a certain way. It's harder loving yourself than loving someone else. Honestly, let's admit that the standards you put are harsher on yourself. Now, it's time to forgive ourselves.  <br>-BTS</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>어쩌면 누군가를 사랑하는 것보다
                      더 어려운 게 나 자신을 사랑하는 거야
                      솔직히 인정할 건 인정하자
                      니가 내린 잣대들은 너에게 더 엄격하단 걸
                      이제는 나 자신을 용서하자<br>-BTS</blockquote>

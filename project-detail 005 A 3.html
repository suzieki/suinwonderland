                    <h2 class="mb-3">If you’re a pro-Kpop fan, you might probably be familiar with these words that I mentioned below. </h2>

                    <p>BUT if you’re new to K-pop, welcome to the K-pop world and you might be wondered some of the slangs that are mostly being used only in the K-pop world like MV comment section, V LIVE, fansites, fandom group chats and so on. 
<br>
</p>
                    
                    <br><p><i>1.	Homma  (홈마)/ Home masters</i> <br> <br>
                      Homma  (홈마)/ Home masters are also known as fansite masters. They are fans who attend idols’ fansign events or concerts to take stunning photos of the idols whom they stan or their bias in an idol group. Then, they post images on their fansites. The controversial thing is that they have been called out for being a stalker of K-pop idols. Usually, the photos provided by home masters are way better than the photographers hired by the agency of the idols.  <br> <br>
According to namuwiki /나무위키 (2021), Homma is defined as “카메라를 들고 아이돌들의 스케줄을 따라 다니면서 사진과 동영상을 찍는 사람들을 말한다. 일반적으로 '홈마', '홈마스터'라는 약칭이 더 자주 쓰인다. 한류 세대 이후의 외국 케이팝팬들은 한글 '마스터님'을 그대로 영자 표기한 'masternim'이라고 부른다” <a href="https://namu.wiki/w/%ED%99%88%ED%8E%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%A7%80%20%EB%A7%88%EC%8A%A4%ED%84%B0"><strong>(나무위키, 2021).</strong> </a>
 <br> <br> According to my English translation, Homma refers to those “who take pictures and videos while carrying cameras and following idols whenever idols have schedules. It is generally abbreviated and used as ‘homma’ or ‘homemaster’. In the Korean wave generation, foreign K-pop fans call Masternim in English by just directly using the term Masternim in hangul. 
<br>
</p>
                    
                    <br><p><i>2.	Maknae on Top (막내온탑)</i> <br> <br>
                      Maknae (막내) means the youngest one in a family or in a group, which is an expression in Korean. In the K-pop world, Maknae is often being used to refer to the youngest member of an idol group. For example, Jungkook is a Maknae in BTS. In Korean culture, the younger ones have to obey and respect what the older one says. BUT Maknae on Top means the hyungs (형들)/ other older members do not usually have much power over Maknae and let the Maknae[s] do anything they want. Or. they may appear to be beneath them because of their excessive love over the Maknae. Sometimes, the term ‘Evil Maknae’ is adorably used for Maknaes especially those who have manipulative mind or behaviour. Another related term would be ‘Golden Maknae’ which is often being used to describe a Maknae who is a pro in all performances like dancing, singing or perfect visual and so on. 
<br>
 </p>
                    
                    <br><p><i>3.	Aegyo (애교)</i> <br> <br>
                      Aegyo (애교) means an irresistible babyish action in term of voice or facial expression to be cute. Sometimes, when an idol is doing Aegyo, their fan usually expresses it like a ‘cuteness overload’, which means difficult to handle because of overwhelming cuteness. 

 </p>
                     
                    <br><p><i>4.	Fanchant (응원법)</i>  <br> <br>
                      Literally, Fanchants are the phrases that fans shout to cheer up an idol for their performance. Fan chants are a big thing for all K-pop fandoms. Agency of the idols or the idols themselves or fans creates the fan chants. As Jessie said, “idols need the support and love of fans to be an idol”, fan chants are important because fan chants are a way of showing love by fans and it is a motivation for the idols. Fan chants often include not only the names of each member of a group but also some part of the lyrics of a song. Fan chants also differ from each group and each song. In other words, fan chants are differently written for each song and a particular idol group. As we know, Kpop idol performance includes both singing and dancing, which is a tiring job. K-pop idols work hard and practice tirelessly. So, fan chants are vitamin for idols to motivate them and comfort them that fans appreciate and recognize the hard work they put. It is a way of saying that “they did a good job or well done”. Hence, fan chants create a kind of connection between idols and fans.   </p>

                    <br><p><i>5.	Comeback (컴백)</i> <br> <br>
                      If you aren’t a K-pop fan, you might probably interpret the word ‘Comeback’ as the return of an artist after taking a long break or after they’ve been cancelled. In the K-pop world, ‘Comeback’ is used whenever a group releases a new song or a new album. For example, an idol group from YGE (YG Entertainment Company) usually has one Comeback per year. Every Comeback has a unique concept and theme that idols adopted in their performances and promotions. </p>

                    <br><p><i>6.	Bias or Choi-ae (최애)</i><br> <br>
                      Bias or 최애 [choi-ae] means an ultimate bias. It’s abbreviated for ‘최고로 애정하다', which means ‘to love the most.’ Usually, the No. #1 favourite character is being called as 최애캐 [choi-ae-kae], which is an abbreviation of ‘최고로 애정하는 캐릭터’. It means ‘the character I love the most.’ So, Bias refers to the most favourite member in a group.  Sometimes, ‘Bias group’ is also often used to describe the most favourite group. ‘Ult Bias’ can also be used to favourite idol out of all the groups. It means an ultimate bias.  </p>
                      
                    <br><p><i>7.	Bias Wrecker or Cha-ae (차애)</i> <br> <br>
                      ‘Bias wrecker’ or (차애) refers to a second favourite member in an idol group, who has a higher chance of becoming your new favourite one. Bias wrecker is the second favourite after your bias.  </p>

                    <br><p><i>8.	Big Three privilege </i> <br> <br>
                      The Big Three refers to the three big entertainment companies that have launched the most successful idols and are believed to have majority influence over the K-pop world. The Big Three includes: <br><br>
SM Entertainment (BoA, TVXQ, Girls’ Generation, SHINee, EXO, Red Velvet, NCT, Aespa, etc.) <br> <br>
JYP Entertainment (Rain, G.O.D, Wonder Girls, 2PM, 2AM, Miss A, Got7, Day6, Twice, Boy Story, Stray Kids, Itzy, NiziU ) <br> <br>
YG Entertainment (Sechs Kies, Big Bang, 2NE1, Akdong Musician, Winner, iKON, BLACKPINK, Epik High, Psy, Treasure) <br><br>
All Big Three have a large fan base, the highest views, and the most popular talented artists. Currently, there is a heated debate over whether the Big Three should be changed into the Big Four by including Big Hit Entertainment (Previous name) or HYBE Corporation a.k.a HYBE LABELS (New Re-branded label name), which manage BTS, TXT, ENHYPEN. Also, NU’EST and Seventeen are under HYBE LABELS because HYPE is a majority shareholder of Pledis Entertainment. HYBE LABELS also had acquired KOZ Entertainment which is a label founded by Zico. HYBE LABELS also acquired Source Music, which is home to GFriend. Even though HYBE LABELS is a successful label in the present, some fans against including it in Big Three because HYBE LABELS is a new one compared to the senior entertainment companies, which gain success since long time ago.

                    <br><p><i>9.	All-Kill (올킬, AK) </i> <br> <br>
                      ‘All-Kill’  (올킬, AK)  is a term being used when an idol group or solo artist achieves #1 on all of the main Korean music charts: iChart Weekly, iChart Realtime, Melon Daily TOP 100, Melon 24Hits, Genie TOP 100 Daily, Genie TOP 100 Realtime, FLO Realtime, VIBE Today Top 100, Bugs Song Chart Daily, Bugs Song Chart Realtime.
‘Perfect All Kill’ (퍼펙트 올킬, PK or PAK) means that a song achieves No. #1 perfectly. <br><br>
#1 on all real-time charts <br><br>
#1 on all daily charts <br><br>
#1 on Instiz Weekly Chart, which is updated hourly, by adding hourly points of the song into its weekly cumulative point.
  </p>
                    <br><p><i>10.	Sasaeng fan (사생팬)/ (私生팬)</i> <br> <br>
                      Sasaeng fan indicates to fans who turned from just a fan into an obsession and becoming like a stalker. The term comes from Sasaeng (사생), which means private life. Hence, the term as a whole means an obsessive fan who invades the privacy of the idols by waiting for their idols at their dorms or homes. Sometimes, they steal idols personal items, belongings, and information. Even their passport, mobile phone number and digging up information about idols’ family members. They also send an inappropriate gift to the idols. Their action is not only disrespectful to the idols and family members but also make idols uncomfortable and unsafe.  </p>

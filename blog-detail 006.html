                    <h2 class="mb-3">This is my experience of wisdom tooth extraction and some of the recovery tips that I did but remember that it’s extremely important to follow your dentist instructions. </h2> <br>

                    <p>I got surgical extraction of my wisdom tooth on September 14, which is my dad’s birthday. If you are wondering why I needed to have my wisdom tooth removed, one of my wisdom teeth was pushing against my other tooth next to it and was starting to form cavities between teeth. So, if I wait for more, I could have problems later on and there will be more damages to my other teeth. And as I age, the bones in my mouth get harder, which makes my teeth tougher to remove and I might have heavy bleeding. My three other wisdom teeth and other teeth are in a good condition. (I want to say thank you to my mom and dad for taking care of my teeth when I was young.) 
                      <br> Anyway, I want to share my experience of wisdom tooth extraction and some of the recovery tips. 
                    </p>
                    <p>1) Book your surgical appointment before or after your period  <br> <br>
                      I made an appointment for surgery before my period begins because it is tough to deal with periods and the pain from wisdom tooth extraction at the same time. It would be better to make an appointment based on your period if you don’t want to handle both. <br> I also had to take COVID test since I haven't vaccinated yet. I don't trust the vaccines in Thailand because many people are saying like vaccines are from China. I'll definitely have to get vaccinated in LA later, but anyway, it's a bit painful in my nose before the surgery. </p>
                    
                    <br><p>2) Applying an ice pack <br> <br>
                      Applying an ice pack to your face will reduce swelling and keep you comfortable. So, wrap ice packs with a cloth and apply them every 20 minutes.  </p>
                    
                    <br><p>3) Follow Dentist instructions <br> <br>
                      Dentist instructions will help blood clots forming where your teeth were pulled, which is extremely important because blood clots are what stops the bleeding as well as stops your pain. 
If you get a dry socket, this can delay the healing process by at least two weeks. A dry socket is what happens when a blood clot fails or the clot comes out too soon, which then exposes the jawbone underneath. The goal is to prevent this so that you can heal quickly. 
<br> To prevent dry sockets and heal quickly is to follow your dentist’s instructions. </p>
                     
                    <br><p>4)	Bite on gauze for about an hour after the extractions.   <br> <br>
                      Don’t freak out if it looks like you’re bleeding crazy because it’s the mixture of your blood and saliva. Oozing can be normal and switch to a clean piece of gauze. It can bleed up to 24 hours, so don’t worry too much about bleeding. </p>

                      <br><p>5)	Don’t spit. </p>

                      <br><p>6)	Don’t use straws.</p>

                      <br><p>7)	Don’t suck on anything like candies.</p>

                      <br><p>8)	Don’t rinse your mouth immediately after the surgery. </p>

                      <br><p>9)	Don’t brush or floss the surgical area. </p>

                      <br><p>10)	Don’t sneeze or cough. </p>

                      <br><p>11)	Don’t elevate your heart rate with too much physical exertion. </p>

                      <br><p>12)	Stick with resting and relaxing on your bed.</p>

                      <br><p>13)	Don’t lay flat and make sure to elevate your head with extra pillows when you lay down.</p>

                      <br><p>14)	Don’t drink hot beverages and alcohol.</p>

                      <br><p>15)	Don’t eat spicy foods. </p>

                      <br><p>16)	Take pain meds that have been prescribed to you by your dentist. (The dentist gave me Ibuprofen and Amoxycillin. I took Ibuprofen because I have an allergy to paracetamol like my dad.) </p>

                      <br><p>17)	Drink lots of fluids when the numbness wears off, but don’t use a straw. </p>

                      <br><p>18)	Eat soft nutritious food (I couldn’t even eat pudding because of the pain, so I had porridge as much as I could.)</p>

                      <br><p>19)	Avoid crunchy foods. </p>

                      <br><p>20)	After 48 hours, if you can open your mouth a little bit wider, you can brush your teeth with a baby toothbrush. Be super gentle. Brush as slowly as you can. Don't get close to the surgical area. Don't touch the surgical area. (About brushing teeth, you need to ask your dentist. For me, I did after 48 hours.) </p>

                      <br><p>21)	Rinsing your mouth with saltwater, but make sure to move your head to switch it back and forth, but not with your cheek. A very gentle rinse with your head moving. Not with your mouth or cheek. </p>

                      <br><p>22)	Be careful because heavy swishing has the potential to dislodge the blood clot, which leads to a dry socket. </p>

                      <br><p>23)	Last but not least, be patient and wait to heal slowly. Take it easy. </p>
